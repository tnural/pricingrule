### Requirements
- Jdk 18
- Gradle 7.4.1
- Lombok IDE configuration (if needed)

### How to run
- $**_./gradlew bootRun_** run command in the root of project to start web server.
- $**_./gradlew clean test_** run command in the root of project to run the tests.

### Daily notes
- task was pretty straightforward, every task implementation from scratch using in memory DB takes time, I spent more time on testing than task's itself, so that caused me some overtime.

### My two cents as feedbac
- of course in this task I avoided soo many things, those immediately coming in my mind, might be logging,validation,error handling, schema definition, localization, virtualization and more depending on request, I have knowledge how to provide them, but in terms of simplicity I just tried to show how I approach to the problem.
